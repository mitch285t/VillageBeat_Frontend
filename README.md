<h1> Village Beat </h1>
<h2> Follow bands and send some support at the same time! </h2>


<p> This app was created with a real life issue i experienced with seeing local bands live 
  I was at a local dive bar and was listening to this band absolutely shred. They had a tip jar but sadly like so many other people in 2019 I just don't carry cash. Another issue was that I had no idea what the name of the band was! </p>
 
 
 <p> That's where VillageBeat comes in.. 
  The core idea of this app and what i hope to build someday is an app that local bands can use to gain follows and also generate revenue for their art. In this application you are able to tip a band and it will automatically follow that band! You can also follow the band for free if you are broke like I usually am! 
I hope you get the concept and dig it like I do. Music is beautiful and anything I can do to help bring more of it to more people is pretty rad. </p>
